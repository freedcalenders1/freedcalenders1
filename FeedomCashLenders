Most banks, credit unions, and online lenders donâ€™t offer personal loans for less than $1,000.
You can get a $500 loan in other ways in addition to some personal loans, such as via a cash advance on your credit card, a payday loan, or a loan app.
A small loan like a payday loan can be useful in an emergency, but you will likely face higher interest rates.
If you have a good credit score, it may make more sense to take out a slightly larger personal loan.
